## Story

### Ideas

* The characters are part of a secret intelligence agency (SIA) and the MC is a victim stalking that gets attacked one night and Ciel saves her and brings her to the headquarters of the SIA
* The MC unkowingly is the child of the villain of the story
* The stalker is actually a subordinate of the dad (aka villain) and the dad doesn't know that the child is alive but the subordniate does
* The stalker (yuki) is actually in "love" with the MC which is the reason he is risking getting in trouble by not telling the MC's dad that they're still alive
* The dad wants the MC dead because he sees family as a weakness
* The SIA tries to help her and they then uncover the truth about the MC (which the MC isn't even aware of) and momentarily think of them as a traitor

#### Story

Ciel used to get bullied for being too feminine and weird. His classmates would discreetly hit him and lock him up in small spaces and throw things at him. One time one of his bullies injured his forhead which caused a scar that is visible even now but that was the last straw for Ciel and he fought back for the first time. Nowadays he has severe anger issues that are caused by his past trauma.
